# Calculating-probabilities-of-winning-in-the-lottery
In this project I defined several functions to calculate probabilities of winning in the lottery, in particular:

* `one_ticket_probability()` — calculates the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket.
* `check_historical_occurrence()` — checks whether a certain combination has occurred in the Canada lottery data set.
* `multi_ticket_probability()` — calculates the winning probability for any number of bought tickets between 1 and 13,983,816.
* `probability_less_6()` — calculates the probability of having two, three, four or five winning numbers

The main goal of this project is to showcase my knowledge of the Probability theory and ability to translate this knowledge into the Python's code.
